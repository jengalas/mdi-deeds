The deed for this parcel has not yet been located. However, we do have the deeds for the sale by Ebenezer Leland of the two lots into which he broke the original parcel: one lot (90 acres more or less; see 2:464 below) being the eastern "half" and the other lot (100 acres more or less; see 2:420 below) being the western "half". The compass direction of the east bound of the eastern lot (S 24&#176; W) is the same as the compass direction (though in the opposite direction) of the boundary of the adjoining parcel belonging to Joseph Hopkins. The eastern lot was sold first and mentioned that its western bound was the land still owned at that time by Ebenezer Leland. The deed for the western lot mentioned that the eastern bound of that lot was land of Samuel Hull, the person to whom Ebenezer Leland sold the eastern lot. That second deed also mentions that the original 200-acre parcel was purchased by Ebenezer Leland from "B. DeGregoire, Esq<sup>r</sup>." on 28 March 1792. From this information, we can reconstruct the original deed as follows:<br><br>
