The purpose of this web page is to report the deeds for all the land on Mount Desert Island that is now part of Acadia National Park.

         How this page is organized:
      </font>
</font>
Deeds for land that is now part of Acadia National Park are listed in chronological order. Earlier deeds were for large tracts of land purchased by or received as gifts to the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations, an organization that then turned over the land to the United States of America to be part of originally (8 July 1916) Sieur de Monts National Monument, later (26 February 1919) Lafayette National Park, and finally (19 January 1929) Acadia National Park. Later deeds were for smaller, but nevertheless significant, parcels. Following the passage (25 September 1986) of Public Law 99-420 ("An act to establish a permanent boundary for the Acadia National Park in the State of Maine, and for other purposes"), small parcels outside the newly established boundary were sold and inholdings were purchased, a process that has not yet been completed.

The deed for this parcel has not yet been located. However, we do have the deeds for the sale by Ebenezer Leland of the two lots into which he broke the original parcel: one lot (90 acres more or less; see 2:464 below) being the eastern "half" and the other lot (100 acres more or less; see 2:420 below) being the western "half". The compass direction of the east bound of the eastern lot (S 24° W) is the same as the compass direction (though in the opposite direction) of the boundary of the adjoining parcel belonging to Joseph Hopkins. The eastern lot was sold first and mentioned that its western bound was the land still owned at that time by Ebenezer Leland. The deed for the western lot mentioned that the eastern bound of that lot was land of Samuel Hull, the person to whom Ebenezer Leland sold the eastern lot. That second deed also mentions that the original 200-acre parcel was purchased by Ebenezer Leland from "B. DeGregoire, Esq<sup>r</sup>." on 28 March 1792. From this information, we can reconstruct the original deed as follows:<br/><br/>

After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.

The effect of the above transactions was that Cornelius Thompson Jr. became the owner of the 100 acres on 8 March 1813. Eleazar Ingalls recouped the $133 that he lent to Joseph Ireson, who put up the 100 acres for collateral, plus $37 more as a result of his sale of the land to Cornelius Thompson Jr. on 8 March 1813. Cornelius Thompson Jr. ultimately paid $225 for the 100 acres (= $170 to Ingalls + $55 to Ireson). Ireson thus received only $188 (= $133 from Ingalls via the original mortgage + $55 from Thompson Jr. as part of Thompson Jr.'s consolidation of his ownership of the 100 acres) for the 100-acre parcel that he had purchased from Ebenezer Salisbury for $500 in 1801.

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.
</P>

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.

<!--<P>
After you cross the bridge from Thompson Island onto Mount Desert Island, you are on land purchased on 28 March 1792 from Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire for "five Spanish milled dollars" paid by Joseph Mayo, who was already a "settler on the land". This parcel includes land in Bar Harbor and Trenton (yes, Trenton extends onto Mount Desert Island), and some of it is now owned by the United States of America as part of Acadia National Park.
