The deed for this parcel has not yet been located. However, we do have the deeds for the sale by Ebenezer Leland of the two lots into which he broke the original parcel: one lot (90 acres more or less; see 2:464 below) being the eastern "half" and the other lot (100 acres more or less; see 2:420 below) being the western “half”. The compass direction of the east bound of the eastern lot (S 24° W) is the same as the compass direction (though in the opposite direction) of the boundary of the adjoining parcel belonging to Joseph Hopkins. The eastern lot was sold first and mentioned that its western bound was the land still owned at that time by Ebenezer Leland. The deed for the western lot mentioned that the eastern bound of that lot was land of Samuel Hull, the person to whom Ebenezer Leland sold the eastern lot. That second deed also mentions that the original 200-acre parcel was purchased by Ebenezer Leland from “B. DeGregoire, Esq<sup>r</sup>.” on 28 March 1792. From this information, we can reconstruct the original deed as follows:<br/><br/>

The effect of the above transactions was that Cornelius Thompson Jr. became the owner of the 100 acres on 8 March 1813. Eleazar Ingalls recouped the $133 that he lent to Joseph Ireson, who put up the 100 acres for collateral, plus $37 more as a result of his sale of the land to Cornelius Thompson Jr. on 8 March 1813. Cornelius Thompson Jr. ultimately paid $225 for the 100 acres (= $170 to Ingalls + $55 to Ireson). Ireson thus received only $188 (= $133 from Ingalls via the original mortgage + $55 from Thompson Jr. as part of Thompson Jr.'s consolidation of his ownership of the 100 acres) for the 100-acre parcel that he had purchased from Ebenezer Salisbury for $500 in 1801.

When the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations presented more than 6000 acres to the United States of America on 10 June 1916 (568:509–521), the land to become the Sieur de Monts National Monument and ultimately Acadia National Park, the description of the land started with "Beginning at a large hemlock tree". Nearly 125 years earlier, in March of 1792, this hemlock tree marked the southwest corner of the parcel conveyed to Humphrey Stanwood by Bartholomy and Maria Theresa DeGregoire (1:376–377 below).
