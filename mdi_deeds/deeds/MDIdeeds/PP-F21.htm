In 1761 the first settlers of European origin moved onto Mount Desert Island and brought with them a concept of individual land ownership. Between that date and the division of the island by the General Court of Massachusetts, the name for the legislature of that state (which included what is now Maine), there were land sales, very few of which are recorded in the Hancock County Registry of Deeds. One was the sale of a lot of land to Benjamin Bradstreet Stanwood by Thomas Foss on 10 April 1784. From the description this appears to cover at least some land that was later sold by Bartholomew and Maria Theresa De Gregiore to Solomon Higgins (1:363&#8211;364; 28 March 1792) and/or to Humphey Stanwood (1:376&#8211;377; 2[8?] March 1792.<br>
