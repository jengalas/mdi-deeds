         How this page is organized:
      </font>
   </font>
Deeds for land that is now part of Acadia National Park are listed in chronological order. Earlier deeds were for large tracts of land purchased by or received as gifts to the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations, an organization that then turned over the land to the United States of America to be part of originally (8 July 1916) Sieur de Monts National Monument, later (26 February 1919) Lafayette National Park, and finally (19 January 1929) Acadia National Park. Later deeds were for smaller, but nevertheless significant, parcels. Following the passage (25 September 1986) of Public Law 99-420 ("An act to establish a permanent boundary for the Acadia National Park in the State of Maine, and for other purposes"), small parcels outside the newly established boundary were sold and inholdings were purchased, a process that has not yet been completed.
